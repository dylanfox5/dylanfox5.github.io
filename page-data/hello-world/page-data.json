This may include JavaScript programming tutorials, project walkthroughs, and productivity tips. My goal is to help other developers derive value from my experiences and build confidence in their programming skills.</p>\n<h2>About Me</h2>\n<p>I grew up and reside in Kansas City, Missouri. I attended Graceland University ('21) and received degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Data Science. I'm currenty working on a Master's in Data Science and will finish in May 2023.</p>\n<p>Upon graduating in 2021, I started working for Evolytics as an Analytics Developer. This role helped refine my skills as a developer and learn new traits as a consultant. I helped several companies write software and build or maintain analytics architecture, most notably Realtor.com, Kroger, AtHome.com, and Hagerty Insurance.</p>\n<p>In the long-term, my career goals are to build my own open-source software platform that boosts people's work productivity. I strive to use my time in the most efficient manner, so researching and trying new productivity methods is a passion of mine.</p>\n<p>Outside of work and studying, I live an active lifestyle. I enjoy running and training for marathons, playing in the local soccer league, and spending time outdoors. I believe it's important to take care of our bodies, and I find myself happiest when I can enjoy these activities.</p>\n<h2>What's to come?</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, I want to share my experience with other developers. Here are a few topics to look out for in the near future:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project Walkthroughs\n<ul>\n<li>Portfolio Site</li>\n<li>Calendar Dashboard</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>JavaScript Programming Tutorials\n<ul>\n<li>What is the spread operator?</li>\n<li>How can I write a fibonacci function in JavaScript?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Productivity Tips\n<ul>\n<li>The Time Sector Method</li>\n<li>Refine JavaScript Skills by Integrating with Productivity Tools like Todoist</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of these pique your interest, be sure to follow me on social media or check back soon for when the posts drop!</p>","categories":["Welcome","Introduction"],"date":"December 30, 2022","description":"Hello World!
