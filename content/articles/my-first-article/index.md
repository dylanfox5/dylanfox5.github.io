## Welcome!

This is my first blog post. I plan to use this space as a way to write down interesting thoughts, share JavaScript programming knowledge, and layout tutorials for various portfolio projects. My goal is to help other developers derive value from my experiences and build confidence in their programming.

## About Me

I grew up and reside in Kansas City, MO. I attended Graceland University from 2017-2021 and received degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Data Science. I'm currenty working on a Master's in Data Science and plan to finish by May 2023.

Upon graduating in 2021, I started working for Evolytics as an Analytics Developer. This role helped refine my skills as a developer and learn new traits as a consultant. I helped several companies write software and build or maintain analytics architecture, most notably Realtor.com, Kroger, AtHome.com, and Hagerty Insurance.

In the long-term, my career goals are to build my own open-source software platform that boost people's work productivity. I strive to use my time in the most efficient manner, so researching and trying new productivity methods is a passion of mine.

Outside of work and studying, I live an active lifestyle. I enjoy running and training for marathons, playing in the local soccer league, and spending time outdoors. I believe it's important to take care of our bodies, and I find myself happiest when I can enjoy these activities.

## What's to come?

As I mentioned earlier, I want to share my experience with other developers. Here are a few posts to look out for in the near future:

- How to build your own portfolio/blog site using GatsbyJS
- How to build a calendar dashboard, complete with a backend and database
- How to use Todoist to effectively manage tasks
- Various JavaScript programming tutorials

If any of these pique your interest, be sure to follow me on social media or check back soon for when the posts drop!
