## Welcome!
I plan to use this space as a way to share my experiences as a software developer and connect with like-minded individuals. This may include JavaScript programming tutorials, project walkthroughs, and productivity tips. My goal is to help other developers derive value from my experiences and build confidence in their programming skills. 

## About Me

I grew up and reside in Kansas City, Missouri. I attended Graceland University ('21) and received degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Data Science. I'm currenty working on a Master's in Data Science and will finish in May 2023.

Upon graduating in 2021, I started working for Evolytics as an Analytics Developer. This role helped refine my skills as a developer and learn new traits as a consultant. I helped several companies write software and build or maintain analytics architecture, most notably Realtor.com, Kroger, AtHome.com, and Hagerty Insurance.

In the long-term, my career goals are to build my own open-source software platform that boosts people's work productivity. I strive to use my time in the most efficient manner, so researching and trying new productivity methods is a passion of mine.

Outside of work and studying, I live an active lifestyle. I enjoy running and training for marathons, playing in the local soccer league, and spending time outdoors. I believe it's important to take care of our bodies, and I find myself happiest when I can enjoy these activities.

## What's to come?

As I mentioned earlier, I want to share my experience with other developers. Here are a few topics to look out for in the near future:

- Project Walkthroughs
  - Portfolio Site
  - Calendar Dashboard
- JavaScript Programming Tutorials
  - What is the spread operator?
  - How can I write a fibonacci function in JavaScript?
- Productivity Tips
  - The Time Sector Method
  - Refine JavaScript Skills by Integrating with Productivity Tools like Todoist

If any of these pique your interest, be sure to follow me on social media or check back soon for when the posts drop!
