I'm a <u>software developer</u> living in Kansas City, Missouri. I specialize in innovating creative experiences for the web and developing analytics architecture.

Shortly after graduating from Graceland University in 2021, I joined the <u>Analytics Development</u> team at Evolytics. I spend my days supporting clients as they implement and maintain analytics architecture and data-collection strategies across large-scale websites. 

After joining Evolytics, I decided that I wasn't finished with my education and started a <u>MS in Data Science</u> program at the beginning of 2022.

<u>Outside of work or school</u>, you can find me training for my next marathon, playing soccer with some friends, or working on a passion-project.
